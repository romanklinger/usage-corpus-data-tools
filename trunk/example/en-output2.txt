1351	B003SQ7I5S	R1S662FSJCYV9S	Rapid Washer - DIY Manual Hand Washing Machine	Fantastic!	I have been using this for 2 weeks and it really does a great job! My clothes are coming out very clean.  When you push it up and down you can hear the air whoosh out the vent and feel the suction where it is pulling the water through the dirty clothes. To rinse them, you simply put 2 - 4 inches of water again in your bucket or sink and agitate them again. Only a couple minutes on wash and another minute on rinse and they are nice and clean.  Also, you use significantly less detergent than is required in a washer. This is because of how it pulls and pushes the water through the clothes with force!  Very sturdy I expect to use it for many years.
3144	B007HDDMNK	R2GMA4BS5LFPDU	Danby DDW1899WP 8 Place Setting Portable Dishwasher - White (Misc.)	Love it!	As the other reviews have stated, the user manual leaves a little bit to be desired, but otherwise this is a wonderful little dishwasher.  I happened to find a deal and got it shipped to a local store slightly cheaper than I could buy it here.  But if I hadn't checked on Amazon I would never know how to run the dishwasher as it looks like the user manual was written by someone that has never heard English. It works better than I ever expected it to and I love it.
1156	B005BFZ66C	R329LXFK7N347O	Panasonic NN-SN661S Genius 1.2 cuft 1200-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology, Stainless Steel (Kitchen)	Powerful and elegant!	Sure beats the heck out of our old white Wal-Mart microwave.  Before when a meal said 3 minutes, we would cook for 4 minutes and still have cold food.  Now we have quicker meal prep and, to top it all off, it looks great!  Very happy with this purchase!
