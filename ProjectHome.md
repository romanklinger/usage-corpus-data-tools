The tools published in this project are additional tools for the data published at
http://dx.doi.org/10.4119/unibi/citec.2014.14

This tool downloads Amazon reviews from the German or the English Amazon website given review ids.

A very similar tool is the crawler by Andrea Esuli (http://www.esuli.it/) which can crawl huge sets of products given product IDs. So if you search for a tool which can help you in building a corpus, you should try his tool: http://www.esuli.it/fossil/repo/amazonReviewsDownloader/

The tool on this website is mainly for use with the corpus mentioned above.
